# [Lagrange interpolation](Lagrange.h)

This method build the polynomial function that matches the given points, for use it this function needs a x arr and y arr of the same length ant the number n of that array size, and return a stirng with the formula, this does'nt resolve the multiplications avoiden aproximation mistakes. 

#[Split differences (Newton)](splitDiferences.h)

This method as the langrange method return a polynomial function that matches the givens points and return a mathematical expresion. Also this method is optimized for uniformed spaced cases
