# [Lagrange interpolation](Lagrange.h)

This mwthod build the polynomial function that matches the given points, for use it this function needs a x arr and y arr of the same length ant the number n of that array size, and return a stirng with the formula, this does'nt resolve the multiplications avoiden aproximation mistakes.
